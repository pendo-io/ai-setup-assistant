### How to Use

1.  **Utilize the Prompt:** Copy the provided prompt to your selected AI tool. 
2.  **Provide Your Snippet:** Paste the Pendo snippet you obtained from your Pendo account.
3.  **Review the Plan:** The assistant will analyze your codebase and propose a complete implementation plan, including snippet placement, initialization logic, and user/account data mapping.
4.  **Confirm and Implement:** Review the proposed changes, confirm they look correct, and the assistant will apply the changes directly to your project.

### What It Does Automatically

* **Framework Detection:** Supports popular frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, Next.js, and Nuxt, as well as multi-page applications (MPAs) and micro-frontends.
* **Snippet Placement:** Intelligently places the Pendo loader in the correct file (e.g., `index.html`, `_app.js`, `_document.js`) based on your project's structure.
* **Data Mapping:** Automatically scans your codebase for user and account data, mapping fields like `id`, `email`, and `role` to Pendo's `visitor` and `account` objects. It also detects and includes additional metadata.
* **Configuration Generation:** Creates a complete `window.pendo.initialize()` call tailored to your application's data sources and structure.
* **Implementation & Testing:** Implements the changes and provides a custom checklist to help you validate the installation.

### What It Avoids

The assistant is designed to be safe and non-intrusive:

* It **never** exposes sensitive data like passwords or tokens.
* It respects your project's existing code style (e.g., semicolons, quotes).
* It provides a confirmation step before any changes are made to your code.

For more details on the assistant's logic and capabilities, please refer to the detailed prompt document.

### How to Review

After reviewing and deploying, you can use Pendo's built-in developer tools to confirm everything is working as expected.

* Run a check: Open your browser's developer console and run `pendo.validateEnvironment()`.
* Verify the output: Look for the following in the console output `pendo.enableDebugging()`:
  * The visitor.id and account.id are present and correctly formatted.
  * All of the metadata fields you intended to map are listed with their correct values.
* Check the UI: Within a few minutes, you should see data from your test environment appear in your Pendo subscription's Raw Events tab under Settings > Subscription Settings > Applications.
